## Installation

To setup everything in `~/etc`, execute the following command:

```sh
source <(curl -sL http://bit.ly/tonekk-dotfiles-script)
```

### Post-install

Apart from the things that gets installed with the command above, we will need to get some additional stuff:
* [Source Code Pro for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) as the terminal font
* [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby) with [ruby-install](https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install) for a decent ruby-environment
* [iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
